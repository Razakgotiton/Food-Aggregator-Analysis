    "The following key areas of analysis will be considered:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Customer Satisfaction Analysis: Analyze the rating data provided by customers to understand the level of satisfaction with different restaurants and cuisines. Identify the factors that contribute to higher customer satisfaction and identify areas for improvement.\n",
    "    \n",
    "\n",
    "* Restaurant Demand Analysis: Analyze the order data to identify the popular restaurants and cuisines among customers. Determine the demand patterns based on weekdays and weekends to optimize the availability of delivery personnel and streamline operations.\n",
    "    \n",
    "\n",
    "* Food Preparation and Delivery Time Analysis: Analyze the food preparation and delivery time data to identify bottlenecks in the process. Identify restaurants or cuisines that consistently have longer preparation times and work towards reducing them to improve customer experience.\n",
    "    \n",
    "\n",
    "* Cost Analysis: Analyze the cost data to identify the average cost of orders and any variations across different restaurants and cuisines. This analysis can help optimize pricing strategies and identify any potential areas for cost reduction.\n",
    "    \n",
    "\n",
    "* Customer Retention Analysis: Analyze customer order history to identify patterns of repeat orders and customer loyalty. Identify strategies to improve customer retention and increase customer lifetime value.\n",
    "    \n",
    "\n",
    "By focusing on these areas of analysis, the food aggregator company can gain valuable insights to make data-driven decisions and improve various aspects of their business, ultimately leading to enhanced customer satisfaction and sustainable growth."
